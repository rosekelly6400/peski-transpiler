To create, compile, and run your Peski code:

4. to compile and run your peski code, use the following command: bash compile.sh {your peski file name here}

As an example, this is what hello world looks like in Peski and the output you would get if you ran it, this file is in the "Peski Compiler" folder under the name hello_world.peski. (fizzbuzz.peski is also in this folder and can be run)
